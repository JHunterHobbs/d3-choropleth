# Description 

This is a React version of a Codepen I created using D3js. This was an interesting project due to the fact that both D3JS and React have their own ways of manipulating the DOM. The project has been structured to leverage vanilla D3 via a JS helper file (no React wrappers or third-party depencies) with a simple React component to create the div that D3 manipulates.
